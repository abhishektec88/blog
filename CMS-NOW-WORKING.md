# âœ… CMS is Now Working - Changes Will Show on UI!

## What Was Fixed

The problem was that Next.js wasn't reading the YAML files correctly. I've fixed it by:

1. âœ… Installed `yaml-loader` - A webpack plugin to load YAML files
2. âœ… Configured `next.config.ts` - Added webpack rules for YAML files
3. âœ… Created `global.d.ts` - TypeScript declarations for YAML imports
4. âœ… Updated `src/lib/content.ts` - Now imports YAML files directly using webpack

### How It Works Now

Instead of using `fs.readFileSync` (which doesn't work well in Next.js App Router), the website now **imports YAML files directly**:

```typescript
// Before (Didn't work)
import fs from 'fs';
const content = fs.readFileSync('content/homepage.yml');

// After (Works!)
import homepageContent from '../../content/homepage.yml';
const content = homepageContent;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still Not Seeing Changes?

1. **Check Netlify Deployment**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Look for recent deployment
   - Must say "Published" (green checkmark âœ…)

2. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Press **Ctrl+F5** (hard refresh)
   - Or open in incognito/private window

3. **Verify Content File**
   - Go to your GitHub repo
   - Check `content/homepage.yml`
   - Confirm your changes are saved there

4. **Wait for Build**
   - Netlify rebuilds after every CMS save
   - Usually takes 1-3 minutes
   - Check Netlify dashboard for build status

## What Was the Issue?

**Before:** The website was using Node.js `fs.readFileSync` to read YAML files, which doesn't work reliably in Next.js 15 App Router during build time.

**After:** The website now uses webpack's `yaml-loader` to import YAML files directly, which works perfectly in Next.js!

## Summary

âœ… **CMS is working**
âœ… **Changes save to YAML files**
âœ… **Website reads from YAML files**
âœ… **Changes show on UI after deployment**

**Your SEO person can now edit content and see the changes on the website!** ðŸš€
