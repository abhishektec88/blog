# How the CMS Works - Your Content is Now Live! ðŸŽ‰

## What Changed?

Your website **now reads from the YAML content files** instead of using hardcoded values!

### Before (Hardcoded):
```tsx
<h1>Grow faster with data-driven marketing</h1>
```

### After (From CMS):
```tsx
const content = getHomepageContent();
<h1>{content.heroH1}</h1>
```
